              <p className="lead">My name is Praveen. Iâ€™ve started my UI/UX Development Learning journey at Tech
                Mahindra Smart Academy, Visakhapatnam!

                Over the past few weeks, Iâ€™ve been building a strong foundation by learning HTML, CSS,
                Bootstrap, and JavaScript, and Iâ€™m currently diving into modern frontend technologies like
                React.js. ðŸ’»

                The journey so far has been incredible â€” understanding how to structure responsive layouts,
                enhance user interfaces, and create interactive web experiences. Canâ€™t wait to apply these
                skills in real-world projects and continue exploring the world of UI/UX and frontend
                development! ðŸš€</p>
